                <div id="talk">
                <p>I have been coding for over 5 years, the start of my journey was lockdown 2020. Initially, I learned lua and built small Roblox Games.</p>
                <p>I went on to develop on and off on roblox until around mid-2023 when I followed a tutorial to make my first Python Project. I quite frankly enjoyed it, but didn't continue with it just yet... </p>
                <p>In late 2023 until early 2024, I was back making simple roblox games for my friends and family to enjoy.</p>
                <p>In mid-2024 I started my first official project: Ticket Time, a simple Ticket Bot for discord that didn't store your data, and was free to use. Ticket Time was a great experience and still is, as I am now developing it with multiple developers and expanding it's reach into other languages.</p>
                <p>In late 2024, I started to learn JavaScript and HTML/CSS, and I am now working on a website for my projects.</p>
                <p>In early 2025, I have continued to expand my knowledge of Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS.</p>
