        <div id="sectionTitle">Introduction</div>
        <br>
        <p>Technology is a constantly evolving field, and I have always been fascinated by how software can bring people together, automate tasks, and create meaningful experiences. My journey as a developer began with a simple curiosity about how things work, leading me to build my first Python-based Snake game in 2022. Since then, I have continued developing my skills, working on a diverse range of projects—including custom Discord bots, web applications, and developer tools—all aimed at improving efficiency, fostering collaboration, and enhancing digital experiences. As a self-driven developer, I specialize in Python, HTML, and JavaScript, leveraging these languages to create tools that benefit online communities. Over time, I have not only built projects for my personal growth but have also contributed to open-source development, ensuring that others can learn from and improve upon my work.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div id="sectionTitle">Discord Bot Development & Automation</div>
        <br>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Watch;Dog</strong> - The steward of "; semi-colon", my developer-focused Discord community. Watch;Dog is more than just a simple bot; it is an essential pillar of moderation, order, and information sharing. It ensures that the community runs smoothly, preventing spam, enforcing rules, and even providing automated updates. What makes Watch;Dog stand out is that it is open-source, allowing developers within the community to analyze, modify, and contribute to its ongoing development. The source code is publicly available on my website for those interested in learning from or enhancing its functionality.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ticket Time</strong> - A multilingual Discord ticketing system, enabling efficient customer support and issue resolution within Discord communities. Unlike traditional ticketing bots, Ticket Time supports multiple languages—currently English, Spanish, French, Arabic, and German, with planned expansions into Russian, Mandarin, and more. This bot has been incredibly useful for server administrators who manage large communities.</li>
          </ul>
        <br>
        <p>These bots have significantly improved automation within Discord communities, reducing the workload for moderators and enhancing user experiences.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div id="sectionTitle">Building a Community for Developers – "; semi-colon"</div>
        <br>
        <p>One of my proudest achievements is the creation of "; semi-colon", a rapidly growing Discord community for developers. The goal of this server is to bring together individuals from diverse technical backgrounds—whether they specialize in coding, 3D modeling, game development, cybersecurity, AI, or other digital fields.</p>
        <p>"; semi-colon" is designed to be a collaborative hub where developers can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Share projects</strong> and get feedback from peers.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Find resources</strong> to enhance their coding skills.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Discuss technical challenges</strong> and problem-solve together.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Collaborate on open-source initiatives.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>To ensure that "; semi-colon" remains organized, secure, and productive, I have developed several custom bots—most notably Watch;Dog, which plays a crucial role in moderating discussions, enforcing rules, and managing automated announcements. This bot is open-source, allowing other developers to explore its code and contribute improvements.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As "; semi-colon" continues to grow, I am committed to expanding its reach, introducing new learning resources, and building more advanced automation tools to support the community.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div id="sectionTitle">Open-Source Contributions & Online Presence</div>
        <br>
        <p>Beyond my personal projects, I strongly believe in open-source development. Making my work publicly available ensures that other developers can learn, build upon, and improve the tools I’ve created.</p>
        <p>To showcase my projects and make them accessible, I maintain an active online presence:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Website: <a href="https://mrharryw.github.io/">mrharryw.github.io</a></strong> – A portfolio of my projects, including open-source bot repositories.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/MrHarryW">github.com/MrHarryW</a></strong> – Hosting code for Watch;Dog, and other open-source initiatives.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>X (Twitter): <a href="https://x.com/Mr_HarryW">@Mr_HarryW</a></strong> – Sharing updates on my latest projects and interacting with the tech community.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div id="sectionTitle">Future Goals & Next Steps</div>
        <br>
        <p>Looking ahead, I am excited to continue pushing the boundaries of development. My future projects will focus on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Expanding "; semi-colon"</strong> into a leading hub for developers, designers, and digital creators.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Improving automation tools</strong> to make online communities safer and more efficient.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Enhancing multilingual support</strong> in my Discord bots to make them more accessible worldwide.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Exploring AI integration</strong> for advanced automation in moderation and customer support.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>No matter where my journey takes me, my goal remains the same: to create impactful digital tools, foster a thriving developer community, and keep learning along the way.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div id="sectionTitle">Conclusion</div>
        <p>From my early Python projects to building a developer community, my journey has been one of constant learning, problem-solving, and innovation. With every project I create, every bot I develop, and every improvement I make to "; semi-colon", I am working toward a future where technology brings people together, simplifies tasks, and opens up new possibilities.</p>
        <p>I am always open to collaborations, new ideas, and exciting challenges. If you’re a fellow developer, designer, or tech enthusiast, feel free to connect with me on GitHub, Discord, or my website. Let’s build something amazing together!</p>
