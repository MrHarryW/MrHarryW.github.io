  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi, I'm Harry! I'm a developer with a passion for creating innovative tools and solving real-world problems. Since I started my coding journey, I've been focused on building applications that are both functional and user-friendly. I specialize in web development, developing Discord bots, and automating tasks to make everyday processes more efficient. My skills include Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and I have experience working with frameworks like React and Flask. I believe in writing clean, well-documented code that is not only effective but also easy to scale and maintain.</p>
  <p>I’m always striving to improve my skills and stay up to date with the latest trends in technology. As a developer, I enjoy experimenting with new tools and technologies to challenge myself and push the boundaries of what I can create. One of my biggest passions is building Discord bots that enhance community engagement and simplify communication. Whether it’s an automation tool or a game-related bot, I love finding new ways to help people through code.</p>
  <p>Outside of development, I’m an avid gamer, with Sea of Thieves being one of my favorites. I enjoy exploring the vast open seas, collaborating with my crew, and seeking treasure in this dynamic, pirate-themed world. I also enjoy exploring the world of tech gadgets, keeping an eye out for innovations in gaming hardware and software. I’m deeply interested in the intersection of gaming and development, and I’m constantly inspired by how technology is shaping the future of entertainment.</p>
  <p>I’m also focused on continuing to grow as a developer, tackling new challenges, and working on exciting projects. I’m passionate about building solutions that help others, and I’m always open to collaboration with like-minded individuals.  </p>
